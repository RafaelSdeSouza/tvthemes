The `tvthemes` package is a collection of various `ggplot2` themes and color/fill palettes based on everybody's favorite American TV shows. What kick-started this whole package was my [blogpost](https://ryo-n7.github.io/2019-02-15-visualize-brooklyn-nine-nine/) looking at simple TV stats on my current favorite TV show, Brooklyn Nine-Nine. I got a lot of good feedback on the colors I used for the custom `ggplot2` theme and color palettes so I decided to expand it to other shows!

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
pacman::p_load(ggplot2, dplyr, tvthemes, extrafont)
loadfonts()
```


```{r}
mpg %>% 
  ggplot(aes(displ)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(fill = class), col = "black", size = 0.1) +
  scale_fill_brooklyn99_dark() +
  labs(title = "Cars and stuff",
       subtitle = "Terry LOVES ggplot2!") +
  theme_brooklyn99()
```


## List of available TV shows

- __Avatar: The Last Airbender__: theme + palettes (Fire Nation, Water Tribe, Earth Kingdom, Air Nomads)
- __Brooklyn Nine-Nine__: theme + palettes + custom header
- __Game of Thrones/A Song of Ice & Fire__: palettes (Stark, Lannister, Tully, Baratheon, Targaryen, Tyrell, Greyjoy)
- __Rick & Morty__: palette
- __Parks & Recreation__: two themes (light and dark) + palettes
- __The Simpsons__: theme and palette
- __Spongebob Squarepants__: theme and palette


## Installation

`tvthemes` is currently available only on Github, you can install it by:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages(devtools)
devtools::install_github("Ryo-N7/tvthemes")
```

I hope to have a CRAN version soon!

## Fonts

The difficulty with a lot of the fonts used by TV shows in their logos and other paraphernalia is that they are custom-made fonts made by font foundries and therefore can be rather expensive (for a regular person like you or me). So I endeavoured to find FREE fonts to use that were somewhat similar to the real ones used by the show from resources like `Google Fonts`. In the documentation you can find the __actual__ fonts used by the TV shows if you are so inclined to buy them! In some cases there were fan-made fonts such as "Some Time Later" for Spongebob or that I was able to include within the package. Instead of dealing with `extrafont` yourself I repurposed the `import_*()` functions from the `hrbrmstrthemes` package so you can import the fonts yourself very easily. Do note that you still might need to install the fonts directly on your computer from the files found in `inst/fonts`.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
import_simpsons()
import_theLastAirbender()
import_rickAndMorty()
import_roboto_condensed() ## hrbrmstrthemes
import_spongeBob()
import_southpark()
```
